# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game primarily played on Android. The player controls a bird, Faby, navigating it through pairs of pipes. Faby descends automatically and ascends when the player taps the space key. Each successful navigation earns a point. The game ends when Faby collides with a pipe or the ground.
